# פרוטקטורון – רובוט מגן בטכנולוגיות AI / Protectoron AI Guardian Robot Datasheets

This repository contains datasheets and documentation for the final project "פרוטקטורון – רובוט מגן בטכנולוגיות AI" (Protectoron – AI Guardian Robot). The project aims to develop an autonomous, intelligent robotic system based on Raspberry Pi 5, Raspberry Pi 4, ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors and modules. All datasheets for the components used are stored in the `datasheets/` directory for reference.

## Contents

- **`datasheets/` directory** – contains PDF datasheets for sensors (e.g., color sensor, ultrasonic sensor), microcontrollers (STM32F103, ESP32), servos, cameras, motor drivers, and other modules used in the robot.
- **Hardware interface manual** – the `Transbot Hardware interface manual.xlsx` file documents wiring and interfacing of the board.

## Description

Protectoron is an AI-powered robotic vehicle designed to autonomously detect, identify and help neutralize potentially dangerous objects using machine learning, computer vision and remote control capabilities. The robot integrates multiple sensors such as cameras, ultrasonic and color sensors, heart-rate monitor, inertial measurement units and a voice interaction module to navigate and interact with its environment. It features a 3 ‑DOF robotic arm, tracked chassis and high ‑torque servos to manipulate objects safely, as well as remote monitoring and control via Wi ‑Fi.
